# Pandas-Challenge

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your local government area. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyse the area-wide standardised test results. You'll be given access to every student's maths and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.


# Analysis

The dataset analyses a total of 39,170 students across 15 schools.  The total student average maths score is 70.34%  and the average reading score is 69.98%.  Of the total 15 schools, 7 of these schools are government funded and 8 of the schools are independently funded.  

The government funded schools all have a higher student count (between 2,739 to 4,976 students) than the independent schools (between 427 to 2,283).

When taking a closer look at the results we can see that:
- Independent schools have a higher overall passing rate at 76.973% than government schools at 70.968%
- Small & medium schools have a higher overall passing rate at 78-79% than the large schools at 70%
- The schools with a lower budget per student (under $630) have a higher passing rate at 76-80% than those schools with the highest budgets ($645 - $680) at only 66 - 67%
- In the bottom 5 schools, 4 of them were government schools
- More students are passing maths than reading, with the LGA summary showing % passing maths at 86.076% compared to reading at 84.426%

What we can conclude here is:
- Having a higher budget per student doesnâ€™t not yield better results
- Independent schools outperform government schools
